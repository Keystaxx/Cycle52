        My name is Keanu Glover and i am a young, motivated, creative man. I have lived in fifteen states. Traveling gave me a different outlook on life and i did not realize that until i got older that my time traveling was building me to be a leader. I was able to see so many different walks of life, I have lived in the cold and the heat, I lived in the projects and the suburbs, I've been to private, public, and charter schools. Thoose experences have given me the gift of adapbility and understanding. I love playing basketball, the game was my escape from feeling like i didn't fit in. I learned confidence, authenticity, hardwork, and resilency. I have a younger brother i love him even when we bump heads, my mom is my heart shes so amazing, my dad is my jedi master i like to say they raised a great young man. I love to cook as well i love to cook for other people and watch the look on their face when they enjoy my food because people think i only play sports.

    <p style="color:purple"> When i was in middle school i was always the shy kid moving from city to city. I kind of grew up in isolation not having childhood friends and always trying fit in new friend circles. I chose this video because Kobe was my favorite player and after learning his story i saw similarites in his up bringing. Not just this video but every video i hear Kobe speaking gives me goose bumbs and i listen very closley and apply that knowlege about the game or life to my charachter. Kobe never gave up, he always pushed through adversity, and never cheated himself. I took thos principles and applied them to myself and my work ethic even to this day. </p>
